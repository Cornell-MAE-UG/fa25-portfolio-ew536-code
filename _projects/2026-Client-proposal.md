# Pre-Harvesting Apparatus Client Proposal
**Team:** The Entomophiles
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension/E&J Gallo Winery/National Grape  
 
## Problem statement 
Spotted lanternflies (SLF) infest grapevines, contaminating harvests. We aim to remove ~90% before harvest. Because grapes are fragile and SLF adhere strongly, removal requires substantial but carefully controlled force.


## Impact
This product will allow grape farmers to solve the issue of SLF within harvested crops, allowing for more loads to be accepted alongside large-scale removal operations.  


## Proposed direction(s): Pre-Harvest Processing


**What it is:** An apparatus that is mounted to the front of a harvester and removes the SLF before the harvesting begins. We will use water or air, and either flood or direct the fluid towards SLF.
 

**How it would be used:**


- Device mounts to the harvester and connects to water, air, and/or power.
- Apparatus dislodges SLF from vines immediately prior to harvest.
 

**Why it’s better than the status quo:**


- Addresses problem in short term regarding yield
- More adaptable to existing infrastructure  


**End-of-semester proof-of-concept:** A battery-powered miniature prototype will use air and/or water (directed or undirected) to remove simulated SLF (miniature suction cups) from a simulated or real grape vine, supplied by a water tank.


## Key risks/unknowns

- SLF removal may dislodge grapes or damage vines, reducing yield and future harvests; this can be tested using simulated SLF on real vines with fruit.
- Fluid use may oversaturate soil or contaminate crops; non-water chemicals could affect grape quality or food safety. We would use soil-safe fluids and minimize volume.



## Questions for the client


1. **How much water / air pressure is necessary to wash off SLF?**  

   *Decision affected:* Determination of optimal force to apply. 
   


2. **What are the dimensions and physical limitations of the harvester?**  

   *Decision affected:* Determination of apparatus size, fluid output, system complexity.



3. **Is a stable water supply available, and can the harvester power a compressor?**  

   *Decision affected:* If not, air requires onboard compression and water requires onboard storage, increasing weight.
