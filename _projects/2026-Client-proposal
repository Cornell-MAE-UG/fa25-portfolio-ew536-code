# Pre-harvesting Apparatus Client Proposal
**Team:** The Entomophiles
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E\&J Gallo Winery / National Grape  
 
## Problem statement (most important)
Spotted lanternflies (SLF) are an invasive species that have greatly disrupted commercial grape production by aggregating on and feeding from grapevines, reducing crop quality, inhibiting ripening, and contaminating harvests.
Our main target is removal of roughly 90% of SLF in a single harvest/load immediately prior to harvest, in comparison with a non-treated infested vineyard. An alternative measure of success is to have fewer than 1-2 SLF remain in a core sample of 1000 grams of grape crops, since that is the criteria by which loads get rejected according to the guest lecture. Equivalently, we aim to have SLF comprise less than 2% of the weight of a core sample of harvested grapes. 
Several factors have complicated existing SLF removal efforts. Immediately before harvest, grapes are extremely delicate and vulnerable to damage, so any applied force must be controlled to minimize loss of grapes in the removal process. Additionally, although limited research has been done on SLF grip strength on plant surfaces, they have strong grip on vehicle exteriors up to 100kmh [1], so sufficient force must be applied to dislodge SLF while keeping grapes intact. 




## Impact
This product will allow grape farmers to immediately solve the issue of SLF within harvesters, allowing for more loads to be accepted without having to worry about large-scale removal operations. Furthermore, this solution can be implemented without further infrastructure, allowing for rapid adoption.


## Proposed direction(s)


### Concept A (primary): Pre-Harvest Processing


**What it is:** Our primary concept is an apparatus that is mounted to the front of a harvester, which removes the spotted lanternflies before the harvesting begins. We will use either water or air, and either flood or direct the fluid towards the bugs. A multi-stage solution can be implemented, using a combination of a series of processes with the described systems.
**How it would be used:**
- Apparatus attaches to the harvester before harvesting of grapes
- Water/air and electricity is hooked up to apparatus
- Apparatus is enabled prior to harvesting of grapes
- Apparatus removes SLF prior to harvesting
- Apparatus can be removed after harvesting
**Why it’s better than the status quo:** <2–3 bullets.>
- Addresses problem in short term regarding yield
- More adaptable to existing infrastructure
- Relative ease of scalability  
**End-of-semester proof-of-concept:**
Our end of semester proof of concept will be a miniature prototype of the device, which uses a combination of air and water, either directed or undirected, in order to remove simulated spotted lanternflies from a simulated grape vine. The device will operate on battery power and be connected to a water tank.


## Key risks / unknowns


- SLF removal methods could remove grapes — If grapes are removed outside of the collection system, then that would decrease the total yield of the harvest. This can be tested by creating “dummy” SLF, and testing on a real grape vine.
- removing SLF could damage the grape plants — Any damage to the physical plant could decrease the production of future harvests. This can be tested by using the removal method directly on the plant, and inspecting for damage. 
- usage of fluids could oversaturate the vineyard or contaminate the grape harvest — Spraying a significant amount of water or other fluid on the grapes prior to harvest could seep into the soil with adverse effects of vine/grape growth. Chemicals other than water that have not been thoroughly tested on vineyards may affect the quality of the grapes over time or impact food safety.


## Questions for the client
Focus on questions they can answer from lived experience.
1. **How much water / air pressure is necessary to wash off SLF?**  
   *Decision affected:* This will help us determine how much force we should use to remove SLF while keeping as many grapes intact as possible. 
2. **What are the dimensions and physical limitations of the harvester?**  
   *Decision affected:* This will limit how large our apparatus can be, and in turn how much of our final fluid we can output, and the complexity of our perception system.
3. **Is there a water supply in the field, and can a compressor be attached and powered by the harvester?**  
   *Decision affected:* If the harvester cannot be modified to have a compressor attached to it, then it would be difficult to use air to blow off the SLF as the system would have to be pre-pressurized. If there is no available water hookup, then water would have to be carried on the harvester which would add considerable weight.
4. **What course of action is taken when a significant amount of SLF is encountered?**  
   *Decision affected:* Other mediums/methods that can be automated through a pre-harvesting process in addition to directed/undirected water/air.
