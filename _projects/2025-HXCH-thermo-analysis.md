Heat exchangers are widely used in real-world applications to control temperature for efficiency and safety. They are part of power generation, heating and cooling, and industrial processes and enable the transfer of thermal energy between fluids at different temperatures without direct mixing. In this project, a heat exchanger was run in different modes and analyzed experimentally to evaluate its thermal performance and to assess the validity of common thermodynamic assumptions, including steady-state and adiabatic operation.

## Setup
A lightly-guided, hands-on experimental setup was provided, consisting of a heat exchanger connected to four water buckets driven by pumps. Temperature measurements were taken from the water buckets. 

Supplies used:
• one heat exchanger
• two water pumps
• 4 water buckets
• ice
• water
• styrofoam for insulation (for the cold water source)
• an immersion heater (for the hot water source)
• one thermocouple
• four thermometers
• food dye (for visually distinguishing flow)

## Analysis
Typically, several assumptions that do not reflect reality are made to simplify thermodynamic analysis. 
The heat exchanger was set up in parallel and in counterflow.
